# scripts-and-stuff
Useful scripts and various other things which I use on a day-to-day basis
There's not much to say, except the code will probably be lazier and more slapdash than usual. I bet you didn't think that was possible.

## Contents:
* desktop_autohotkey.ahk - A collection of AutoHotkey scripts which I use day to day on Windows to makes life easier.
* room heating.py - A python script, most of which I didn't write which turns on and off the heating system in my house based on the temperature.
* RuneMateUpdater.java - A simple updater for the standalone JAR version of RuneMate. If you add it as a pre-build task in IntelliJ, it saves a lot of annoyance with manual updates, assuming you want to keep your project self-contained.
* useful excel stuff.txt - Contains a few Excel scripts I've written which I don't want to forget.
