# scripts-and-stuff
Useful scripts and various other things which I use on a day-to-day basis
There's not much to say, except the code will probably be lazier and more slapdash than usual. I bet you didn't think that was possible.

## Contents:
* BotWatch - a program for monitoring your RuneScape bots - you give it an FTP server name, username, password, public web root, and computer name via command line. It will then screenshot all open RS instances running on the local machine every 20 seconds and upload them. You can then go to your webroot /your computer name + "index.html" to view these images.
* desktop_autohotkey.ahk - A collection of AutoHotkey scripts which I use day to day on Windows to makes life easier.
* room heating.py - A python script, most of which I didn't write which turns on and off the heating system in my house based on the temperature.
* RuneMateUpdater.java - A simple updater for the standalone JAR version of RuneMate. If you add it as a pre-build task in IntelliJ, it saves a lot of annoyance with manual updates, assuming you want to keep your project self-contained.
* useful excel stuff.txt - Contains a few Excel scripts I've written which I don't want to forget.
